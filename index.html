    <h1 id="nope">What are bineural beats?</h1>
    <p id="para">
      Bineural beats is an auditorial illusion that occurs when two different
      tones are played simultaneously. Bineural beats are linked to increased
      concentration, alertness and improved memory among other positive results.
      From just 30 Minutes of REM sleep you can become fully rested because your
      mind is rested from even 30 minutes of a deep rem sleep which can be
      induced by bineural beats.
